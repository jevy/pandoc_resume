I have managed remote teams of 12 engineers, designers and product
managers in diverse industry sectors. While designing innovative
products for clients, I've learned how to be a lean and proficient
product manager, facilitating efficient coordination among all team
members.

I'm awesome at leading product teams, engineering teams or applied data
science teams.

  {\bf Triage.com: CTO and Director of Product Engineering:}

  Stepping into a CTO role to fill a 5 month vacuum in technical/product
  leadership, I encountered a ton of tech, management and emotional
  baggage to work through with the team. I took over all product
  management and technical architecture for the company:

  \startitemize[packed]
  \item
    Built the first publicly available, Deep Learning skin classifier
    app for over 124 dermatological conditions.
  \item
    Lead the technical FDA submission documentation and internal
    compliance process.
  \item
    Lead the new product design of our internal data exploration and
    data analysis tool on over 2 TB of images in our data storage.
  \item
    Worked with the data management team to stop doing manual labelling
    of data. Coached the team to build Mechanical Turk tasks, recruited
    a team of 20 dermatologists to classify skin conditions in images
    and a team of General Practitioners to help build our symptom
    checker database.
  \item
    Restored collaboration between the data management and data science
    teams. We worked to isolate problem areas and come up with more
    functional systems. They are now working nearly as as single team.
  \item
    To clarify its priorities and direction, I transitioned the entire
    company from Github issues to Clubhouse, resulting in positive
    design decisions and tangible feedback that it produced new momentum
    for the company.
  \item
    Set up and implemented the core company KPI reporting in Metabase,
    where they were posted to Slack on a daily/weekly basis.
  \item
    Immediately implemented bi-weekly one on ones with everybody on my
    team to coach individuals through their technical and professional
    challenges and found external counselling and mentorship as needed.
  \item
    Hired 2 engineers and 3 devops consultants in my first 2 months.
  \item
    Conducted team video training sessions on effective use of our tech
    tools. This improved communication and boosted the quality of
    product development.
  \item
    Implemented a career ladder for the data science and software
    engineering teams, resulting in concrete plans to set expectations
    and manage performance, growth and retention strategies.
  \stopitemize

  All this was accomplished as several team members and I worked
  remotely. The team includes 6 Data Scientists, 4 Engineers and 3 Data
  Managers working with:

  \startitemize[packed]
  \item
    Keras
  \item
    Virtualization: Docker/Kubernetes in Debian Linux
  \item
    React and Javascript
  \item
    Ruby on Rails
