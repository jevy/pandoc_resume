<p>I have managed remote teams of 12 engineers, designers and product managers in diverse industry sectors. While designing innovative products for clients, I’ve learned how to be a lean and proficient product manager, facilitating efficient coordination among all team members.</p>
<p>I’m awesome at leading product teams, engineering teams or applied data science teams.</p>

<dd><p><strong>Triage.com: CTO and Director of Product Engineering:</strong></p>
<p>Stepping into a CTO role to fill a 5 month vacuum in technical/product leadership, I encountered a ton of tech, management and emotional baggage to work through with the team. I took over all product management and technical architecture for the company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built the first publicly available, Deep Learning skin classifier app for over 124 dermatological conditions.</li>
<li>Lead the technical FDA submission documentation and internal compliance process.</li>
<li>Lead the new product design of our internal data exploration and data analysis tool on over 2 TB of images in our data storage.</li>
<li>Worked with the data management team to stop doing manual labelling of data. Coached the team to build Mechanical Turk tasks, recruited a team of 20 dermatologists to classify skin conditions in images and a team of General Practitioners to help build our symptom checker database.</li>
<li>Restored collaboration between the data management and data science teams. We worked to isolate problem areas and come up with more functional systems. They are now working nearly as as single team.</li>
<li>To clarify its priorities and direction, I transitioned the entire company from Github issues to Clubhouse, resulting in positive design decisions and tangible feedback that it produced new momentum for the company.</li>
<li>Set up and implemented the core company KPI reporting in Metabase, where they were posted to Slack on a daily/weekly basis.</li>
<li>Immediately implemented bi-weekly one on ones with everybody on my team to coach individuals through their technical and professional challenges and found external counselling and mentorship as needed.</li>
<li>Hired 2 engineers and 3 devops consultants in my first 2 months.</li>
<li>Conducted team video training sessions on effective use of our tech tools. This improved communication and boosted the quality of product development.</li>
<li>Implemented a career ladder for the data science and software engineering teams, resulting in concrete plans to set expectations and manage performance, growth and retention strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this was accomplished as several team members and I worked remotely. The team includes 6 Data Scientists, 4 Engineers and 3 Data Managers working with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keras</li>
<li>Virtualization: Docker/Kubernetes in Debian Linux</li>
<li>React and Javascript</li>
