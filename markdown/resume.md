I have been starting companies since I was 13 years old. I have built and managed remote teams of up to 12 engineers, designers and product managers in various businesses. When building products for myself and for clients, I learned to became a trial by fire proficient lean product manager. This allows me to effectively factiliate between all types of team members.

I’m currently based in Ottawa, Canada, and am exclusively interested in remote-only positions (with some travel).

I'm interested in leading either product or engineering teams or a combination of both. I'm also comfortable managing Data Scientists where there is a desire to make them more product focused.
